# FXML-Declaration-Helper
A plugin for IntelliJ which allows you to generate FXML declarations on the fly, rather than having to type them all out!
If you'd like to add this to IntelliJ, it can be found in the JetBrains plugin repository: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7821?pr=
I'd probably class this as a horrible hack, but I wrote it for my own utility rather than anything else, and it seems that more than 300 other people appreciate it at least in some way, so it's probably here to stay, even if it was initially written when I had little knowledge of Java.
